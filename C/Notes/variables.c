// GP, Variable Notes For C
#include <stdio.h> // lets us create inputs and outputs

int main() { // always has to be inside of a function
    int number = 12; // every statement has to end in a semi collen // must put int, float, or char before variable name
    float pi = 3.14;
    printf("We have the number %d\n", number); // d is a placeholder for int // \n tells the computer to move to the next line
    printf("%f\n", pi); // f is a place holder for float
    return 0; //always is the last line of main
}
